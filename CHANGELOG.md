## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Always-on **VPN interface guard** (`vpn.enabled: true`): egress is allowed only
  through the tunnel, cutting a tunnel drop with a zero leak window, with a bounded
  root-triggered **switch window** as the only sanctioned relaxation.
- **Country-blocklist fallback** (`vpn.enabled: false`): polls the public IP and
  cuts traffic by destination country for hosts not behind a VPN.
- Cross-platform `FirewallBackend` seam with build-tagged backends: `pfctl`
  (macOS), `nftables` (Linux), WFP/`netsh` (Windows).
- CLI subcommands: `run`, `block`, `unblock`, `status`, `panic`, `install`,
  `uninstall`, `start`, `stop`, `detect-vpn`, `validate`, `print-rules`, `doctor`,
  `monitor`, `setup`, `version`, plus a global `-v`/`--verbose`.
- Read-only diagnostics that need no root: `validate`, `print-rules`, `doctor`,
  `monitor`.
- macOS **menubar GUI** (`Dezhban.app`, `make gui-macos`): a standalone Swift
  client that reads the daemon state file and drives the CLI.
- Cross-platform release build matrix (`make build-all`) producing five binaries:
  darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64.
