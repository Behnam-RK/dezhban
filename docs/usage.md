`--config` is **optional**: when omitted, dezhban resolves the config from
`$DEZHBAN_CONFIG`, then the canonical system path (`dezhban config path` prints
it), then built-in defaults. So `dezhban run` / `monitor` / `validate` normally
need no path at all.

Privileged commands (`run`, `block`, `unblock`, `panic`, `install`, `uninstall`,
`start`, `stop`) require root/admin. When run without it from an interactive
terminal on unix, dezhban **auto-re-runs itself under `sudo`** (prompting for your
password once) — so you rarely need to type `sudo` yourself. Pass `--no-sudo` (or
set `DEZHBAN_NO_SUDO=1`) to opt out and get the plain "must run as root" error;
on Windows, and when there's no terminal (CI/pipes), it never auto-elevates.
`setup` and `config set`/`edit` elevate just their config write the same way. The
inspect commands (`validate`, `print-rules`, `doctor`, `monitor`) are read-only —
no root, no firewall effects.

```sh
dezhban status                                    # config + service + block state
dezhban status --json                             # machine-readable (merges the state file)
dezhban run --dry-run                             # poll & print country, no firewall
sudo dezhban run --config /etc/dezhban/dezhban.json

# manual block / override
sudo dezhban block   --config configs/dezhban.example.json
sudo dezhban block   --force                      # cut ALL egress, ignore detection
sudo dezhban unblock
sudo dezhban panic                                # standalone teardown, no daemon needed
```

## Key flags

- `run --dry-run` — poll and print the country without touching the firewall.
- `block --guard` — install the VPN interface guard (see [modes.md](modes.md)).
- `block --force` — unconditional hard block of all egress (loopback + allowlist
  only), bypassing the VPN guard. The override when detection is wrong.
- `unblock --force` — accepted for symmetry (`unblock` is already unconditional).
- `--simulate-country IR` (on `monitor` and `run`) — force the verdict from
  anywhere, without a sanctioned IP.

## Diagnose & test safely (no root)

Inspect and validate before you risk a block — none of these touch the firewall:

```sh
dezhban validate    --config <config>                 # parse + validate, summarize
dezhban print-rules --mode guard --config <config>    # exact ruleset, not applied
dezhban doctor      --config <config>                 # tunnels, subnets, endpoint sanity
dezhban doctor --discover --config <config>           # macOS: find the VPN's real server IP
dezhban monitor     --config <config>                 # live: IP, country, tunnels, endpoints, verdict
```

`monitor` streams the live state the decision rests on; add `--once` for a single
snapshot. `print-rules --mode` takes `guard`, `fullblock`, or `legacy`. See
[config.md](config.md) for the full field reference and [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
for the lockout-recovery runbook.

## Create & manage the config

You rarely need to touch JSON by hand. See [config.md](config.md#where-the-config-lives)
for where the file lives and the resolution order.

```sh
sudo dezhban setup                 # interactive wizard — builds/updates the config,
                                   # detects tunnels, previews the ruleset, then writes it
dezhban config path                # print the resolved config path
dezhban config show                # print the effective config as JSON
dezhban config get blockedCountries
sudo dezhban config set blockedCountries IR,RU   # set, validate, save
sudo dezhban config edit           # open the config in $EDITOR, re-validated on save
```

`setup` needs an interactive terminal and reuses the same tunnel detection,
validation, and ruleset preview as `detect-vpn`/`validate`/`print-rules`. Writes to
the system path need root (hence `sudo`); a permission error prints a `sudo` hint.

## Shell completion

```sh
source <(dezhban completion zsh)     # or bash; add to your ~/.zshrc / ~/.bashrc
dezhban completion fish | source     # fish
```

Completes subcommands, `--mode` values (`guard|fullblock|legacy`), the `config`
subcommands, and file paths for `--config`.

## Run as a service

dezhban can install itself as a boot-persistent background service using one
cross-platform API (launchd on macOS, systemd/upstart/sysv on Linux, the Windows
Service manager). The service wraps the `run` loop, restarts on crash, and routes
logs to the platform logger (syslog/journald/Event Log).

```sh
sudo dezhban install --config /etc/dezhban/dezhban.json   # register (default path if omitted)
sudo dezhban start                                        # start now; also auto-starts on boot
dezhban status                                            # → service: installed, running
sudo dezhban stop                                         # stops AND removes firewall rules
sudo dezhban uninstall
```

`stop` cancels the run loop so its deferred `Cleanup()` removes every rule —
stopping the service never leaves a block-all rule behind. If the service crashes
while blocked, the rules persist by design (a kill switch must not fail open); use
`sudo dezhban panic` to flush them even with no daemon running.

## macOS menubar app

On macOS an optional native **menubar app** (`Dezhban.app`) shows the daemon's
live posture at a glance and offers click-to-control. It's a separate Swift/AppKit
target, so the Go binary keeps its zero-dependency, `CGO_ENABLED=0` promise. Build
it with `make gui-macos` (see [development.md](development.md)).

- **Status icon** — 🟢 allow/guard, 🔴 block/full-block, ⚪ stopped or stale;
  repainted about once a second.
- **Menu** — Start/Stop, Block/Unblock, VPN-mode indicator + Open config, View
  logs, Launch at login (`SMAppService`), Quit. Items enable/disable from the
  current state; privileged actions raise a native admin prompt via `osascript`.

The app runs no IP/country poller of its own — it reads the daemon's state file
(see [state.md](state.md)), the single source of truth for what the daemon decided.
It is unsigned for local use (right-click → Open past Gatekeeper); an in-app
VPN-mode toggle is deferred (the menu routes to **Open config…**). Design notes:
