        --no-daemon      skip the control socket, act on the firewall directly (or DEZHBAN_NO_DAEMON=1)
```

`--config` is **optional**: when omitted, dezhban resolves the config from
`$DEZHBAN_CONFIG`, then the canonical system path (`dezhban config path` prints
it), then built-in defaults. So `dezhban run` / `monitor` / `validate` normally
need no path at all.

## Do I need a password?

Mostly, no. Once the daemon is running, the commands you use day to day go **to the
daemon** over its control socket and need no password at all:

| Command | Needs a password? |
|---|---|
| `block`, `unblock`, `switch`, `pause`, `resume` | **No** — the running daemon performs them (see [config.md](config.md#control-block)). Only if no daemon is listening do they fall back — `block`/`unblock` act on the firewall directly; `switch`/`pause`/`resume` write the root-owned command file, which itself needs a running daemon to consume it. Either way, root. |
| `status`, `validate`, `print-rules`, `doctor`, `monitor`, `detect-vpn` | **No** — read-only, no root, no firewall effects. |
| `install`, `uninstall`, `start`, `stop`, `restart` | Yes — a daemon can't install, start, or stop itself. Rare (install-time). |
| `panic` | Yes — deliberately independent of the daemon, so the lockout escape hatch works when nothing else does. |
| `run` | Yes — it *is* the daemon. |
| `setup`, `config set`/`edit` | Yes, but only for the config write itself. |
| `upgrade check` | **No** — read-only, no root. |
| `upgrade download`, `upgrade apply` | Yes — root, macOS only. `download`'s staging directory is root-owned on purpose: a writable-by-anyone staging area would let a local user swap the verified `.pkg` before `apply` installs it. |

`dezhban status` prints a `daemon control:` line saying which mode you're in.

### Touch ID

Touch ID for privileged ops — CLI and menubar app alike — comes from **`sudo` +
`pam_tid`**, which you enable once yourself (macOS 14+):

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so" > /etc/pam.d/sudo_local'
```

That's a change to your system's `sudo` configuration, not to dezhban — it applies
to every `sudo` you run, and survives OS updates (unlike editing `/etc/pam.d/sudo`
directly). `dezhban doctor` reminds you when it isn't set up.

With it in place, the **CLI**'s auto-elevation (`dezhban start` and friends) shows
the Touch ID prompt in the terminal, and the **menubar app** authenticates its
privileged actions (start, stop, install/uninstall, panic, config writes) through
the same mechanism — the system Touch ID HUD — with `sudo`'s timestamp cache making
a second action a moment later silent.

Without `pam_tid`, the app falls back to **Authorization Services** (the API behind
the System Settings padlock; in practice its `system.privilege.admin` prompt is
password-only — SecurityAgent does not offer biometrics for that right, which is
why the app prefers the sudo path), caching the authorization for the life of the
app; and as a last resort, the legacy `osascript` dialog — also password-only. A
cancelled Touch ID (or a closed lid, where the sensor is unavailable) falls
through to the password dialog rather than dead-ending.

When a command does need root and you're on an interactive terminal on unix,
dezhban **auto-re-runs itself under `sudo`** — so you rarely type `sudo` yourself.
Pass `--no-sudo` (or `DEZHBAN_NO_SUDO=1`) to opt out and get the plain "must run as
root" error; on Windows, and when there's no terminal (CI/pipes), it never
auto-elevates. Pass `--no-daemon` (or `DEZHBAN_NO_DAEMON=1`) to skip the control
socket and act on the firewall directly — the escape hatch for a wedged daemon.

A manual `block` **holds**: the daemon suspends its geo state machine until you
`unblock`, so an allowed country won't quietly undo what you asked for.

```sh
dezhban status                                    # config + service + block state
dezhban status --json                             # machine-readable (merges the state file)
dezhban run --dry-run                             # poll & print country, no firewall
sudo dezhban run --config /etc/dezhban/dezhban.json

# manual block / override
sudo dezhban block   --config configs/dezhban.example.json
sudo dezhban block   --force                      # cut ALL egress, ignore detection
sudo dezhban unblock
sudo dezhban panic                                # standalone teardown, no daemon needed
```

## Key flags

- `run --dry-run` — poll and print the country without touching the firewall.
- `block --guard` — install the VPN interface guard (see [modes.md](../concepts/modes.md)).
- `block --force` — unconditional hard block of all egress (loopback + allowlist
  only), bypassing the VPN guard. The override when detection is wrong.
- `unblock --force` — accepted for symmetry (`unblock` is already unconditional).
- `--simulate-country IR` (on `monitor` and `run`) — force the verdict from
  anywhere, without a sanctioned IP.

## Diagnose & test safely (no root)

Inspect and validate before you risk a block — none of these touch the firewall:

```sh
dezhban validate    --config <config>                 # parse + validate, summarize
dezhban print-rules --mode guard --config <config>    # exact ruleset, not applied
dezhban doctor      --config <config>                 # tunnels, subnets, endpoint sanity
dezhban doctor --discover --config <config>           # macOS: find the VPN's real server IP
dezhban monitor     --config <config>                 # live: IP, country, tunnels, endpoints, verdict
```

`monitor` streams the live state the decision rests on; add `--once` for a single
snapshot. `print-rules --mode` takes `guard`, `fullblock`, or `switch`. See
[config.md](config.md) for the full field reference and [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
for the lockout-recovery runbook.

## Create & manage the config

You rarely need to touch JSON by hand. See [config.md](config.md#where-the-config-lives)
for where the file lives and the resolution order.

```sh
sudo dezhban setup                 # interactive wizard — builds/updates the config,
                                   # detects tunnels, previews the ruleset, then writes it
dezhban config path                # print the resolved config path
dezhban config show                # print the effective config as JSON
dezhban config get blockedCountries
sudo dezhban config set blockedCountries IR,RU   # set, validate, save
sudo dezhban config reset vpn.switchWindow       # restore a shipped default (--all: every tunable)
sudo dezhban config set vpn.tunnelInterfaces=utun4 \
     vpn.autoDiscoverEndpoints=true                # several keys, one atomic write
sudo dezhban config edit           # open the config in $EDITOR, re-validated on save
```

`config set` takes either one `<key> <value>` pair or any number of `key=value`
pairs. The multi-pair form applies them all to one in-memory config, validates
**once**, and writes **once** — so there is no ordering to get right (a key whose
validity depends on another, like an endpoint alongside its profile, can come
first) and no half-applied config if one value is rejected. It is also one privileged write, i.e.
one password prompt instead of one per key; the macOS app's VPN Guard pane uses it
for exactly that reason.

`setup` needs an interactive terminal and reuses the same tunnel detection,
validation, and ruleset preview as `detect-vpn`/`validate`/`print-rules`. Writes to
the system path need root (hence `sudo`); a permission error prints a `sudo` hint.

## Connect & switch VPNs

After a one-time `setup`, run dezhban (or install the service) and connect any
VPN. Known VPNs need no ceremony, and a drop or server rotation is covered by the
[automatic reconnect window](../concepts/modes.md#automatic-reconnect-window) with no
interaction; the manual switch window below is the fallback — e.g. for arming a
brand-new VPN while the guard is already holding the line.

```sh
# Known VPNs — register once, then just connect/switch in the VPN's own app:
dezhban vpn add proton --endpoint nl-01.protonvpn.net
dezhban vpn import ~/wg0.conf          # WireGuard .conf / OpenVPN .ovpn / V2Ray JSON
dezhban vpn list                        # profiles + learned endpoints + active state

# A brand-new VPN whose server dezhban has never seen:
sudo dezhban switch                     # open a window (5s default); connect it in its app now
sudo dezhban switch --for 90s --name windscribe   # custom duration + attribution
sudo dezhban switch --cancel            # close the window early
dezhban switch --status                 # is a window open?
sudo dezhban vpn promote <name>         # make a learned endpoint permanent (see: vpn list)
sudo dezhban vpn forget <name>          # drop a learned endpoint
```

`switch` writes a root-owned control file the daemon consumes, then narrates the
window from the state file until it closes. See [modes.md](../concepts/modes.md#switch-window--connecting-a-brand-new-vpn)
for the posture and the real-IP-exposure trade-off.

## Pause protection temporarily

For the times the *correct* traffic is the one the guard blocks — a domestic-only
service that refuses a foreign VPN exit:

```sh
sudo dezhban pause 15m     # real IP for 15 minutes, capped by vpn.pauseMax
sudo dezhban resume        # end it early
```

Unlike `switch`, this doesn't wait for a VPN — it just opens egress for the given
duration and re-arms the guard by itself at the deadline, so there's nothing to
remember to turn back on. See
[modes.md](../concepts/modes.md#pause--deliberately-using-your-real-ip).

## Shell completion

```sh
source <(dezhban completion zsh)     # or bash; add to your ~/.zshrc / ~/.bashrc
dezhban completion fish | source     # fish
```

Completes subcommands, `--mode` values (`guard|fullblock|switch`), the `config`
subcommands, and file paths for `--config`.

## Run as a service

On macOS the [installer](../../README.md#install-macos) (`dezhban-<version>.pkg`) does all of
this for you — it installs the CLI + app and registers the service in one step, with
one password prompt. It deliberately leaves enforcement stopped; run
`sudo dezhban setup` then `sudo dezhban start`. Everything below is the manual
equivalent, and the only path on Linux/Windows.

dezhban can install itself as a boot-persistent background service using one
cross-platform API (launchd on macOS, systemd/upstart/sysv on Linux, the Windows
Service manager). The service wraps the `run` loop, restarts on crash, and routes
logs to the platform logger (syslog/journald/Event Log).

```sh
sudo dezhban install --config /etc/dezhban/dezhban.json   # register (default path if omitted)
sudo dezhban start                                        # start now; also auto-starts on boot
dezhban status                                            # → service: installed, running
sudo dezhban stop                                         # stops AND removes firewall rules
sudo dezhban uninstall
```

`stop` cancels the run loop so its deferred `Cleanup()` removes every rule —
stopping the service never leaves a block-all rule behind. If the service crashes
while blocked, the rules persist by design (a kill switch must not fail open); use
`sudo dezhban panic` to flush them even with no daemon running.

## Upgrade

```sh
dezhban upgrade check              # no root — is a newer release out?
sudo dezhban upgrade download       # macOS only — fetch + verify the .pkg
sudo dezhban upgrade apply           # macOS only — install it, then activate
sudo dezhban upgrade apply --no-activate   # install without restarting
```

`check` works on every platform and is read-only. `download`/`apply` are
macOS only — Linux and Windows package managers own their own upgrade path.
`apply` installs the `.pkg` (zero enforcement gap) and then, unless
`--no-activate`, restarts into it — but only when the daemon's posture makes
that safe (healthy `guard` or `standby`; never `full-block` or an open
switch window). See [docs/upgrade.md](upgrade.md) for the full design: why
it's split this way, the activation gate, rollback, and the menubar app's
**About → Updates** panel.

## macOS app

On macOS an optional native app (`Dezhban.app`) shows the daemon's live posture
and offers click-to-control. It's a separate Swift target (AppKit shell, SwiftUI
main window), so the Go binary keeps its zero-dependency, `CGO_ENABLED=0`
promise. Build it with `task gui:build` (see [development.md](../contribute/development.md)).

Two surfaces, split by urgency:

- **Menubar dropdown — the safety/glance core.** One status line (posture, exit
  country/provider), **Open Dezhban…**, **Block now/Unblock**, the VPN switch
  window (Switching VPN… / Cancel with a live countdown) when in VPN mode,
  **Panic — force unblock…**, Quit. These are the time-critical and
  lockout-recovery actions; they never depend on the main window opening. Items
  enable/disable from the current state.
- **Main window — everything else**, opened from the dropdown or by clicking the
  Dock icon (never automatically at launch). Sidebar sections:
  - **Overview** — live status hero (posture, IP/country, tunnel, endpoints,
    profile, switch-window countdown, enforcement-error banner) plus the daily
    controls and a visually-separated Panic. Degraded states are guided: CLI
    missing, service not installed, and daemon stopped each render an
    explanation with the one relevant action inline (Install service… / Start
    kill switch).
  - **VPN Guard** — edits tunnels/endpoints/autodetection through
    the same validation as `config set`, then (after an explicit restart-warning
    choice) restarts the daemon to apply and verifies the new posture.
  - **Settings** — startup ("Start protection at boot" installs the launchd
    system service so enforcement survives reboots; "Open this app at login" via
    `SMAppService`; essential-event notifications), protection (blocked
    countries, switch-window duration, endpoint grace) applied through one
    validated `config set` batch, and the raw config file escape hatch (some
    advanced options are JSON-only).
  - **Logs & Diagnostics** — read-only `doctor`, a scoped `log show --last 1h`,
    a live `log stream` with Stop (also opens Console.app), and the transcripts
    of window-triggered panic/install/uninstall/apply runs.
  - **About** — version, config/binary paths, posture, service state, and which
    elevation path (Touch ID-capable Authorization Services vs password-only
    fallback) privileged actions will take.

**Status icon** — full-color brand state icons (from `gui/assets/`), shown in both
the menu bar and the Dock tile: teal allow/guard, red block/full-block, amber
warning (switch window open or enforcement error), gray stopped or stale;
repainted about once a second. Outside the assembled `.app` bundle (e.g. a bare
`swift run`) the menu bar falls back to monochrome SF Symbol shields.

**Passwords** — Block, Unblock and the switch window go to the running daemon
over its control socket and raise **no prompt at all**. Only the service lifecycle
(Install/Uninstall/Start/Stop) and Panic raise the native admin prompt, because
neither can be daemon-mediated. Tooltips say which it will be before you click.

The app runs no IP/country poller of its own — it reads the daemon's state file
(see [architecture.md](../contribute/architecture.md#state-export--statejson)),
the single source of truth for what the daemon decided. It is unsigned; `curl`-installed
via `install.sh` it needs no Gatekeeper workaround at all (see [install.md](install.md)),
but a standalone double-click of the app bundle hits Gatekeeper — see
[releasing.md](../contribute/releasing.md#unsigned-artifacts-signed-checksums) for the
bypass. The app's own verification checklist lives in
[testing.md](../contribute/testing.md#macos-app).
